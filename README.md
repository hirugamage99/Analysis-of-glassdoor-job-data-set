# Robust Salary Level Estimation using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a robust machine learning model to estimate salary levels based on various features. The goal is to accurately predict salary levels through a process that includes data cleaning, feature selection, model evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers to improve data quality and model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Performed feature selection to identify the most relevant factors influencing salary estimation.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated multiple models to ensure accuracy and robustness in predictions.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyzed the importance of individual features to interpret model decisions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: R, Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **scikit-learn**: For model building and evaluation.
  - **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - **matplotlib**: For visualizing results.
  - **numpy**: For numerical computations.
